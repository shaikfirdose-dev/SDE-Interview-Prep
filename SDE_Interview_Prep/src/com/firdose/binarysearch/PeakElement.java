//Question:	Leetcode 162
//	A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
//
//	Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
//
//	You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
//
//	You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time

//Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
//Output: 5
//Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
